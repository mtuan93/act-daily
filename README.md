This project is the combination of two of my other projects: Artist Search Engine and Angular Meetings.

This is a web application that allows users to register, login, and post their daily activities. In addition to that, one can look up others via a search box and see his/her daily activities. Finally, anyone can post or delete comments for each activities of other users.

The web is written by AngularJs and the server uses Firebase API as backend service.

Demo:

Clone the project by running: git clone https://github.com/mtuan93/act-daily.git.

Install npm plugins by running: npm install.

Install gulp by running: npm install -g gulp.

Run a local server by running: gulp.

The website is available at: localhost:8000.
